I am a final year undergraduate Computer Science student at Lahore University of Management Sciences.

My research interests are at the intersection of Security, Privacy, and Machine Learning.

For my senior year project, I am working on an AI-assisted approach for the enhancement of existing source code debloating techniques.

I am also interested in research related to security and robustness of Large Language Models.

Research Projects
======
My primary research project, co-advised by Dr. Ashish Gehani (SRI International) and Prof. Sazzadur Rahaman (University of Arizona), focuses on developing an AI-assisted program analysis tool for improving existing source code debloating techniques, which currently struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of program code.

I have also worked on understanding the safety and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various downstream tasks. The work is currently under review at COLING'25. The preprint for the work is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15361).

Experience
======
Currently, I am working as a Student Researcher at the **Security & Privacy Lab** at LUMS, under the supervision of Prof. Fareed Zaffar, focusing on program analysis for software security, and evaluating the security and robustness of Large Language Models.

Moreover, I am also currently working as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the **Computer Vision Fundamentals** course at LUMS, under the supervision of Prof. Murtaza Taj.
