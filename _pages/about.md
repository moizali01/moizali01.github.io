## About

I am a first-year Ph.D. Computer Science student at [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/). I completed my undergrad in Computer Science at [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/). My research interests include program analysis tools, auditing LLM-generated code, and enhancing software security through debloating and ML-based techniques. I also explore the robustness of machine learning models and the design of security guardrails. 

During my undergrad, I have had the good fortune of being advised by [Dr. Ashish Gehani](https://www.csl.sri.com/people/gehani/), [Dr. Sazzadur Rahaman](https://sazzadur.com/), [Dr. Yasir Zaki](https://yasirzaki.net/), and [Dr. Fareed Zaffar](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/422).

## Experience

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the **Technology for People Initiative (TPI)** Lab at LUMS, under the supervision of Prof. Fareed Zaffar, focusing on program analysis for software repair, and evaluating the security and robustness of Large Language Models.
